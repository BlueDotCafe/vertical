                    <h3>From the farm</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Originally I am from a very small wheat farming community. Now I find myself as an adult a part of an exciting new community
                      dedicated to changing how we farm today. I am learning about vertical farming and all the wonderful benefits it can bring local communities. We can increase our returns in business and eliminate so much waste associated with farming by building local grow centers. I love learning about this business, because it is so innovative and will bring so much benefit to the world.</p>

                  <h3>Music</h3>
                  <br>
                  <p>Music has been such a great part of my life. I grew up playing the trumpet and singing. I worked as a professtional singer for hire in Seattle and Los Angeles. I barely survived LA. Don't move there. Later I would attend Berklee College of Music in Boston and loved it. What I learned there changed my life. Now I have my own recording studio. I enjoy working with people remotely from all over the world. I am a true creative at heart; a creative monster. Whatever I can get my hands on. I want to create more!</p>

                  <br>
                  <p>Most recently I was a part of an exciting start up called College of Robotics. We taught kids ranging from 8 to 12 years old the fundamentals of mathmatics and robotics. Programming was a natural progression from that work. I am so thrilled to say that I love programming and have thoroughly enjoyed HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. Not only am I looking forward to learning more, I feel like I have a greater understanding of the world around me, today.</p>
